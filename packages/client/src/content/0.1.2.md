## Darialyst Version 0.1.2

Reminder that if you are looking for a more complete experience closer to the original Duelyst, you should probably play [Duelyst 2](https://duelyst2.com/) instead.

### Known issues

- Card editor: When applying a "Change stats" effect with "set to amount", it set all three stats (attack, hp, speed) instead of letting users choose whuch one to apply.
- Daemonic Lure will move the unit even if it dies from the damage effect.
- When a unit with blast attacks another unit with blast, it counterattacks.
- Password recovery does not work

### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug causing units with grow to gain 2 stacks on their first grow.
